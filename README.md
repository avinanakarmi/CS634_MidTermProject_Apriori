# Association Rule Mining with Apriori and FP-Growth

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation and comparison of association rule mining algorithms, specifically the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms, using a dataset of transactions.

## Contents

1. **Utility Functions**
   - `do_while(check_condition, action)`: Repeatedly executes an action until a specified condition is met.

2. **Data Selection**
   - **Description**: Allows users to select a dataset from a predefined list and prints the selected dataset.
   - **Function**: `read_dataset_input()`

3. **Defining Support and Confidence**
   - **Description**: Prompts users to input thresholds for support and confidence. Validates the input to ensure it falls within the range [0, 1].
   - **Functions**: 
     - `read_threshold()`
     - `threshold_read_condition()`

4. **Reading Transactions**
   - **Description**: Reads a CSV file containing transaction data, processes it into a list of transactions, and prints the data.

5. **Apriori Algorithm Using `mlxtend` Package**
   - **Description**: Applies the Apriori algorithm to generate frequent itemsets and association rules using the `mlxtend` package.
   - **Steps**:
     - Import necessary libraries.
     - Load transaction data.
     - Generate frequent itemsets and association rules.
     - Print the rules and their metrics.
   
6. **FP-Growth Algorithm Using `mlxtend` Package**
   - **Description**: Applies the FP-Growth algorithm to generate frequent itemsets and association rules using the `mlxtend` package.
   - **Steps**:
     - Import necessary libraries.
     - Load transaction data.
     - Generate frequent itemsets and association rules.
     - Print the rules and their metrics.

7. **Implementing Apriori Algorithm Manually**
   - **Description**: Manually implements the Apriori algorithm to generate frequent itemsets and calculates their support.
   - **Functions**:
     - `count_item_freq(itemsets)`
     - `prune_items(last_freq_itemset)`
     - `make_n_itemset(n_itemset)`

## Requirements

- `pandas`
- `mlxtend` (for Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms)
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

To install the necessary packages, you can use the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas mlxtend numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Dataset Selection**: The notebook will prompt you to select a dataset from a list. Enter the corresponding number to choose the dataset.

2. **Thresholds Input**: Provide support and confidence thresholds when prompted. The values should be between 0 and 1.

3. **Transaction Processing**: The notebook will read and process the transactions from the selected dataset.

4. **Association Rule Mining**:
   - **Apriori Algorithm**: Generates frequent itemsets and association rules using the `mlxtend` package.
   - **FP-Growth Algorithm**: Similar to Apriori but often more efficient.

5. **Manual Apriori Implementation**: For educational purposes, the notebook also includes a manual implementation of the Apriori algorithm.

## Output

- The notebook outputs the association rules generated by both the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms, including metrics such as support, confidence, and lift.
- For the manual implementation, it prints the frequent itemsets and their supports.

## Example Output

For example, after running the notebook, you might see results like:

```
Antecedents      Consequents   Support  Confidence
0             (pen)         (cheese)  0.666667        1.00
1          (cheese)            (pen)  0.666667        0.80
...
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the dataset CSV files are located in the `./datasets/` directory.
- The notebook is designed to be interactive and will prompt for user inputs.
